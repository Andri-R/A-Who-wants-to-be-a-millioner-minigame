This is a "Who wants to be a millioner" minigame
There are only 10 levels of questions out of 15 that the initial game format has
The questions are taken from internet games which simulate "Who wants to be a millioner"
For each level of questions there are only 3 optional questions and the question that gets displayed is choosen ramdomly
The first alternative in Level x.txt inside Questions folder is true but in-game they are shuffled
You can:
    -) Choose to answer (A, B, C ,D) in uppercase or lowercase
    -) Choose to retreat when you  get the amount of money you won in the previous level

For the moment there is no help, like 50/50 and game plays in command line
